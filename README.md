## Hello World ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josafat, a Software Developer

I am a Fullstack Software Developer with professional experience since 2019, currently focusing my career on Frontend Development. My background includes projects in both frontend and backend, but over the last years I have specialized in building modern, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces.

I started studying programming in 2015 and worked on several freelance projects before joining the industry as a professional developer. Since then, I have contributed to the development of ERP systems, web applications, and custom solutions across different sectors.

My main expertise lies in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and Laravel, with practical knowledge in cloud computing (AWS). I am also passionate about UI/UX design, always aiming to deliver applications that combine performance, usability, and visual consistency.

Currently, I hold the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and I am pursuing the AWS Developer Associate certification while continuing my degree in Computer Science.
