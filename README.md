## Hello World ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josafat, a Software Engineer

I am a fullstack developer, with +5 years of experience in the professional industry, using various technologies for the development of systems, both in corporate, freelance and/or personal projects.
I am dedicated, learning quickly and very easily.

I started studying programming in 2014 in high school.
Since then I have worked on several projects, few professionals at first and mostly for fun or study, focusing more on guiding high school and college students in their academic projects.

In March 2019 I created a simple social network for fun, which opened the doors and allowed me to start working on systems in the real (professional) world a few months later.
