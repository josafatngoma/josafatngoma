### Hello World ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer

I am a fullstack developer, with +5 years of experience in the professional industry, using various technologies for the development of systems, both in corporate, freelance and/or personal projects.
I am dedicated, learning quickly and very easily.

I started studying programming in 2014 in high school.
Since then I have worked on several projects, few professionals at first and mostly for fun or study.

In March 2019 I created a simple social network for fun, which opened the doors and allowed me to start working on systems in the real (professional) world a few months later.
